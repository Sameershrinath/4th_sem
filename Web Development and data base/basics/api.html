Basically this is a line of code which is used in the cameras we can use, especially if you have no the simply available on Amazon but. If I. Integrate the camera. Here this is the. We can include the with columns especially they are more setup. At particular time we just use my webcam as CCTV camera in this. Project this product. The code will be generated in the pendulum and we can include the in the CCD camera by the Our TCP IP assistance. Hey, Cortana. This place is normal. For example. Columbus website NEEM operation. Oscar. Photo upload. I. Hey, Cortana. A laptop. Hardware. Thank you. I. Hey, Cortana. I am a student of university so. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, like when we focus of. It. OK. PM. Hey. Next I will do next. Yes. Good morning. I hope you know how to make like. And that things that happened today, I hope all more about it. So my idea is I can't stop that thing that we can reduce the rate. So. So. If you click on that button, you have to just say a word. L. Then it send a alert to the nearby people or police station Oregon family. Hey, Cortana.
